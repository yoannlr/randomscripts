# A collection of random scripts

I write many scripts for many purposes.
Since they might also be useful for you, you can find them here.

## Scripts

* tagmusic.sh - tags a collection of music files
* film.sh - plays an ascii film in the terminal
* primenumbercheck.html - a webpage to test wether a number is prime or not
* cleanaudio.sh - removes noise from an audio file with the noise profile `noise.prof`
* ytdesc - generates youtube timecodes and music credits from an [Olive](https://olivevideoeditor.org) video edit
